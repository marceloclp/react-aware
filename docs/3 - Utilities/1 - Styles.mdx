# Styles

ReactAware also exposes a set of utility functions that derivate styling objects
from the exposed component states for the most common use cases.

---

## getEnforcedHeightStyle

Returns a style object with `height` and `maxHeight` set to the provided value
in pixels.

```ts
function getEnforcedHeightStyle(height: number): CSSProperties
```

---

## getScrollableStyle

Similar to `getEnforcedHeightStyle`, but also forces `overflow` to be `scroll`.
This is particularly useful when creating containers that do not have a min
height but still need its content to be scrollable.

```ts
function getScrollableStyle(height: number): CSSProperties
```
