# Introduction

ReactAware is a set of utility components that use inversion of control to
expose some data to the consumer via a render function, instead of having to
separate the logical declarations from the JSX. This will usually result in
shorter code that is easier to read and to maintain.

Let's take a look at how ReactAware can make things shorter and easier to read
by implementing a simple component that wants to have access to its width. This
can be a common use case when implementing components that render different
content based on the width of the screen or a container.

```tsx
const Container = () => {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(0)

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      if (ref.current)
        setWidth(ref.current.getBoundingClientRect().width)
    }
    handleResize()
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize)
    return () => window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize)
  }, [])

  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      My div element is {width}px wide!
    </div>
  )
}
```

Could simply be written like this:

```tsx
const Container = () => (
  <RectAware as="div">
    {({ width = 0 }) => `My div element is ${width}px wide!`}
  </RectAware>
)
```

<Note type="tip">
  `RectAware` will in fact use the
  [ResizeObserver API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver)
  over event listeners, which results in improved performance for just the cost
  of a small polyfill!

## Improved readibility

It's often the case with slightly complex components that require the use of
multiple hooks, that we need to jump between the top of the function - where the
hooks are used, and the JSX, in order to understand how that state is being used.

However, one of JSX strong points is that it does not attempt to split the logic
from the presentational (HTML) layer. Even with modern react, it's still often
that we find ourselves in state hell, having to jump back and forth between
sessions.

ReactAware attempts to improve upon this problem - to however dislikes state
hell, by using inversion of control, resulting in more concise code and improved
readibility.

## Self/environment aware

The utility components exposed by ReactAware implement some sort of awareness
about themselves or its environment, like:

* Its DOM node;
* Its bounding client rect (a.k.a, its dimensions and position on the page);
* The screen dimensions (great for width-based content);
* The mouse position (useful for animations that revolve around mouse movement).

In order to get the most out of the exposed components, ReactAware also exports
a set of helper functions that derive the exposed data into style objects so you
don't have to reinvent the wheel every time!
