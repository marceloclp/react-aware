# ScreenAware

The `ScreenAware` component exposes the width and height of the screen.
Additionaly, if an array of breakpoints is passed to the components, it will
also expose the currently active breakpoint.

The main purpose of this component is to render content based on the width of
the page.

<Note type="success">
  ScreenAware will do some optimizations under the hood like using
  [RAF state](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useRafState.md),
  which triggers state updates on the callback of `requestAnimationFrame`!
</Note>

For a specific device:

```tsx
const MobileOnly = ({ children }) => (
  <ScreenAware>
    {({ width }) => width < MOBILE_BREAKPOINT ? children : null}
  </ScreenAware>
)
```

Or, if you pass down an array of breakpoints:

```tsx
const breakpoints = [
  { name: 'mobile', min: 0 },
  { name: 'tablet', min: 500 },
  { name: 'desktop', min: 1000 },
]
const Media = ({ children }) => (
  <ScreenAware>
    {({ breakpoint }) => ({
      mobile: () => <div>Mobile screen</div>,
      tablet: () => <div>Tablet screen</div>,
      desktop: () => <div>Desktop screen</div>,
    }[breakpoint.name])()}
  </ScreenAware>
)
```

## Props

<PropTable>
  <PropItem name='as' type='TagName | React.FC' default='Fragment'>
    The html element or react component function to render as the base element.
    The component will also accept and pipe down all the intrinsic props
    accepted by the component.
  </PropItem>
  <PropItem name='children' type='RenderFn' required />
  <PropItem name='breakpoints' type='Breakpoint[]'>
    An array of breakpoint objects. If specified, the currently active
    breakpoint will be exposed in the render function.
  </PropItem>
</PropTable>

### RenderFn

The render function has the following signature:

```ts
function children(screen: IScreen, setRef: RefCallback): ReactNode
```

```ts
type IScreen = {
  width: number
  height: number
  breakpoint: { name: string; min: number; max?: number }
}
```

<Note type="warning">
  By default, `ScreenAware` will render as a `React.Fragment`.
