# RectAware

The `RectAware` component exposes the bounding client rectangle of the DOM node
as reactive state.

<Note type="warning">
  Under the hood, `RectAware` will use the
  [ResizeObserver API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver)
  instead of attaching event listeners to the window. This means increased
  performance, but it requires the use of a polyfill!
</Note>

This component is particularly useful content is rendered differently based on
width of their parents or screen. Although, if your component depends on the
screen width, it's recommended to use the `ScreenAware` component instead!

```tsx
const Layout = () => (
  <RectAware>
    {({ width }) =>
      width > DEVICE_BREAKPOINT
        ? <div>Content for large devices</div>
        : <div>Content for small devices</div>
    }
  </RectAware>
)
```

## Props

<PropTable>
  <PropItem name='as' type='TagName | React.FC' default='div'>
    The html element or react component function to render as the base element.
    The component will also accept and pipe down all the intrinsic props
    accepted by the component.
  </PropItem>
  <PropItem name='children' type='RenderFn' required />
</PropTable>

### RenderFn

The render function has the following signature:

```ts
function children(rect: ElementRect, setRef: RefCallback): ReactNode
```

As usual with most aware components, you can render as a `React.Fragment` and
attach the reference yourself. The main reason to do this is if you need to
avoid using a Fragment inside the render function, as oposed to outside when
rendering multiple children:

```tsx
const WithInternalFragment = () => (
  <RectAware as="div">
    {() => (
      <React.Fragment>
        <div>Child 1</div>
        <div>Child 2</div>
      </React.Fragment>
    )}
  </RectAware>
)
const WithExternalFragment = () => (
  <RectAware as={React.Fragment}>
    {(_, setRef) => (
      <div ref={setRef}>
        <div>Child 1</div>
        <div>Child 2</div>
      </div>
    )}
  </RectAware>
)
```

There is no gain in indentation, so it's up to preference of readibility.
