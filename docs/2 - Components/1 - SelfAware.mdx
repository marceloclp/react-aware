# SelfAware

The `SelfAware` component exposes the DOM node of the root element - unless
rendering as a Fragment.

It's the same as declaring your reference at the start of the function, and then
attaching the ref to the desired node, with the exception that the **element is
not reactive**.

```tsx
const SelfAware = () => {
  const ref = useRef(null)
  return <div ref={ref} />
}
```

It's meant to be used inside large UI trees where it can be hard to spot where
the element is being attached, or inside loops.

## Props

| Name       | Type                   | Default     | Description |
| :--------- | :--------------------- | :---------- | :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `as`       | `JSX.IntrinsicElements | React.FC`   | `div`       | The html element or react component function to render as the base element. The component will also accept and pipe down all the intrinsic props accepted by the component. |
| `children` | `RenderFn`\*           | `undefined` |             |

### RenderFn

The render function has the following signature:

```ts
function children(
  element?: Element,
  ref: RefObject,
  setRef: RefCallback
): ReactNode
```

As usual with most aware components, you can render as a `React.Fragment` and
attach the reference yourself. This can be useful if you need access to the DOM
node somewhere up in the DOM tree, and is particularly useful if using inside
async callbacks, as it ensures the value is up to date at the time it is used.

```tsx
const Form = () => (
  <SelfAware as={React.Fragment}>
    {(_, ref, setRef) => (
      <form
        onSubmit={() => setTimeout(() => console.log(ref.current.value), 1000)}
      >
        <input ref={ref} placeholder='Search' />
        <button type='submit'>Search</button>
      </form>
    )}
  </SelfAware>
)
```

For obvious reasons, if your render result is a large tree, you are better off
declaring your reference at the start of the function body.
