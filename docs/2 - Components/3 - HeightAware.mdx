# HeightAware

The `HeightAware` component exposes the height of the DOM node as reactive
state. Under the hood, it's the same as `RectAware`, but optimized to only
rerender when the height changes. And of course, it also makes use of the same
ResizeObserver's API.

This component is particularly powerful when creating scrollable containers
whose parent does not have a fixed height. An example of this would be a flex
item inside a flex column container.

```tsx
import { HeightAware, getScrollableStyle } from '@marceloclp/react-aware'

const Scrollable = ({ items }) => (
  <HeightAware style={{ flexGrow: '1' }}>
    {height => (
      <div style={getScrollableStyle(height)}>
        {items.map(item => <div>{item}</div>)}
      </div>
    )}
  </HeightAware>
)
```

## Props

<PropTable>
  <PropItem name='as' type='TagName | React.FC' default='div'>
    The html element or react component function to render as the base element.
    The component will also accept and pipe down all the intrinsic props
    accepted by the component.
  </PropItem>
  <PropItem name='children' type='RenderFn' required />
</PropTable>

### RenderFn

The render function has the following signature:

```ts
function children(height: number, setRef: RefCallback): ReactNode
```

As usual with most aware components, you can render as a `React.Fragment` and
attach the reference yourself.
